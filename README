[ Introduction ]

TiLib (Tiny Library) is a wavelet-based lossy image compression library.
Library provides simple memory-to-memory interface. TiLib supports famous
Daubechies 9/7 biorthogonal wavelet transform and Butterworth biorthogonal
wavelet transform. All transforms are implemented in a fast lifting mode.
Finally, TiLib uses SPIHT algorithm to encode transformed coefficients.
TiLib can work with either 8-bit grayscale or 24-bit truecolor images.
TiLib supports precise rate control and fully embedded encoding.

This package also contains simple codec (called ticodec) that shows how
to use TiLib for image compression. Look at the source and everything
makes clear! Currently, ticodec supports PGM and PPM formats.

[ P.S. ]

If this program works, than it was written by Alexander Simakov,
if not, than I don`t known who wrote it ;)

And the last, but not the least: if you use TiLib or ticodec in
your project, please let me known. I will be very glad ;)
